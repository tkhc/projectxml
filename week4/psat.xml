      This is a focused course for students who
      have previously taken the PSAT exam as a sophomore
      but did not receive a desired score on the mathematics
      portion or students who will be taking the PSAT and
      wish to strengthen their skills in the mathematics
      area. Outcomes of the course will be measured using
      the original PSAT mathematics score compared to a
      course post-test, or a course pre-test compared to the
      subsequent PSAT mathematics score.
